        "answer": "79",
        "solution": "Using the sum of cubes factorization which says that $x^3+y^3=(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)$, we see that $1343=10^3+7^3=(10+7)(10^2-10\\cdot 7+7^2)=17\\cdot 79$. Since $79$ is prime, the largest prime factor is $\\boxed{79}$.",

                    "Notice that the expression $10^3 + 7^3$ has the form $x^3 + y^3$ where $x = 10$ and $y = 7$. This suggests using a special algebraic identity.",
                    "Recall the sum of cubes factorization formula: $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$. Apply this identity to factor $10^3 + 7^3$.",
                    "Calculate the first factor: $10 + 7$. This should give you a small number that you can easily check for primality.",
                    "Calculate the second factor: $10^2 - 10 \\cdot 7 + 7^2$. Work this out step by step: $100 - 70 + 49$.",
                    "Now you have factored 1343 into the product of two integers. Check whether each factor is prime by testing for divisibility by small primes.",
                    "Compare the two factors you found to determine which one is larger. The larger factor will be your answer, assuming both are prime."
